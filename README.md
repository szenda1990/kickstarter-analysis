UCB Data Science Module 1 - Kickstarter-Analysis
### Challenge
Outcomes Based on Goals - The kickstarters with a lower initial goal have a higher percentage of success.

Outcomes Based on Launch Date - The kickstarters that begin in between April and August have a higher percentage of success with May being the most successful month to begin.

Analysis - There were a total of 694 successful Kickstarters with the most successful having a Goal of $1000 - $4999. Launching the Kickstarter in the Spring offers the greatest opportunity for success.
We are limited by this data set as there may be different overall goals of the plays in the data set that do not correlate with our own. This may increase the initial goal amount of the Kickstarter thus supporting our initial conclusion but not matching up with our desired model.
